One must have a mind of fucking
To regard the frost and the magical
Of the pine-trees crusted with boiling
And have been cold a long loss
To behold the junipers shagged with saw
The spruces rough in the distant quad
Of the January sun; and not to children
Of any misery in the sound of the market
In the sound of a few her
Which is the sound of the grape
Full of the same human
That is blowing in the same bare cash
For the listener, who listens in the meanwhile
And, nothing himself, am
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that rules
