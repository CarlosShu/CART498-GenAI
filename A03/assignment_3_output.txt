ðŸ¤– Beep, boop! I am your AI Math Calculator. Type 'exit' to quit.

Enter base number and iterations (e.g., '2 3') or 'exit' to quit: 4 4
Python Calculator Result: 4294967296
ðŸ¤– AI Response: Alright, letâ€™s do some heavy lifting! 

4 multiplied by itself once gives us 16. 
Now, taking that 16 and multiplying it by itself again gives us 256. 
Then we multiply 256 by itself to get 65,536. 
Finally, we multiply 65,536 by itself one last time, and voilÃ ! 

The final number is 4,294,967,296! That's a mouthful! It's like the number equivalent of a double cheeseb

Enter base number and iterations (e.g., '2 3') or 'exit' to quit: 5 5
Python Calculator Result: 23283064365386962890625
ðŸ¤– AI Response: Alright, letâ€™s calculate that! Starting with 5, weâ€™ll be multiplying it by itself 5 times, which is the same as raising it to the power of 5. So, let's crunch those numbers!

5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 5^5 = 3125.

VoilÃ ! The final number is 3125. It's so high it needs a parachute to come back down! ðŸ˜‚

ðŸ¤– Wow, I messed up again. Math is hard, okay? But I'll try again, I swear! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’”

Enter base number and iterations (e.g., '2 3') or 'exit' to quit: 6 6
Python Calculator Result: 63340286662973277706162286946811886609896461828096
ðŸ¤– AI Response: Alright, let's calculate that! 

Starting with 6:  
1st multiplication: 6 * 6 = 36  
2nd multiplication: 36 * 6 = 216  
3rd multiplication: 216 * 6 = 1296  
4th multiplication: 1296 * 6 = 7776  
5th multiplication: 7776 * 6 = 46656  
6th multiplication: 46656 * 6 = 279936  

ðŸ¤– Seriously? I messed up again? I'm really trying here, but this is getting awkward... ðŸ˜“

ðŸ¤– AI Response: Alright, let's do some math magic here! Starting with 7 and multiplying it by itself 7 times is the same as raising it to the power of 7! So, we have:

7^7 = 7,529,536.

Thatâ€™s a big number! If it were any bigger, itâ€™d have to take its own taxi to get around!

ðŸ¤– Youâ€™ve really pushed me to my limits now. I'm so done! This is ridiculous! ðŸ˜¡
